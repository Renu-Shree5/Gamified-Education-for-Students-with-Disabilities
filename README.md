# Gamified Education for Students with Disabilities

The project aims to develop an immersive and engaging gamified education application tailored for students with disabilities. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies like Python, Unity, Virtual Reality (VR), multimodality, non-player characters (NPCs), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML), the goal is to create an inclusive and personalized learning experience that caters to diverse needs and abilities.

## Features

- **Immersive Virtual Reality (VR) Environments**: Interactive and explorable VR environments for experiential learning, simulations, and skill development.
- **Multimodal Input and Output**: Support for various input modalities (voice, gestures, eye-tracking, alternative devices) and output modalities (visual, auditory, haptic feedback) to ensure accessibility.
- **Intelligent Non-Player Characters (NPCs)**: AI-powered NPCs that serve as virtual guides, tutors, or learning companions, providing personalized support and feedback.
- **Adaptive Learning**: AI and ML algorithms to personalize the learning experience, adapt content delivery, and provide targeted assistance based on individual needs and progress.
- **Gamification Elements**: Engaging gameplay mechanics, rewards, challenges, and narrative elements to foster motivation and engagement.
- **Data Analytics and Reporting**: AI-powered data analysis and reporting tools to track student progress, identify areas for improvement, and inform instructional strategies.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Utilized for backend development, data processing, and integration with AI/ML libraries.
- **Unity**: Game engine for developing immersive 3D environments, simulations, and gamified experiences.
- **Virtual Reality (VR)**: Support for popular VR headsets and platforms for creating immersive learning environments.
- **Multimodality Libraries**: Libraries for speech recognition, gesture recognition, eye-tracking, and alternative input/output devices.
- **AI/ML Libraries**: Libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn for implementing AI and ML models for adaptive learning, intelligent NPCs, and data analytics.
- **Firebase**: Cloud-based platform for real-time database, authentication, and cloud storage.
